## Description

1080p Technology was established to enhance the shopping experience for tech-savvy enthusiasts. We aim to provide a wide range of products from the latest smartphones, relevant accessories, and all technology-related things. 

The scope of this web application is based on a full-stack implementation that includes MongoDB, Express, EJS, and NodeJS. This comprehensive technological stack was used to build a fully functional e-commerce site that allows users to buy and sell a wide range of tech products. With a modern, aesthetically beautiful website built to provide convenience and accessibility, the user experience was a top priority. A responsive design and a live search bar, which allows visitors to search for specific items or filter things depending on price range, are notable features. Vendors can list, change, or delete product listings, creating a more dynamic marketplace environment. Furthermore, the platform extends its capability to delivery drivers, allowing them to track ongoing orders that need to be fulfilled.
